# Automated data collection and testing rotary stage

This project is part of my MPhil which tried to use deep learning neural network to test the performance of the new generation of self-powered cochlear implant based on the piezo nano fibre. The stage is meant to test these new sensor based using an spatial and speech recognition data.
